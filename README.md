## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### UPDATE 2025

Refacorted the code one year later after learning much more. Proud of this result

### What I learned

This was definitely a challenge. Formating the lists and tables was difficult and I did not get it quite right. It still looks good I would say but it is not perfect to the design.

### Continued development

I would definitely like to learn the best way to format tables and lists.
